                                        default,
                                        until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
                                        element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                                        and
                                        hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
                                        overriding
                                        our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go
                                        within
                                        the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

                                        until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
                                        element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                                        and
                                        hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
                                        overriding
                                        our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go
                                        within
                                        the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
